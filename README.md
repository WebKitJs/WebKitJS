Coding conventions	- OOP, MVC, JS PseudoClassical inheritance


Dependencies
------------
- jQuery - for dom abstraction and fx
- Plovr - for run time and distribution builds
- Closure Compiler - used for code checking and minification (included by Plovr)
- Google Closure - required use is goog.provide, goog.require (included by Plovr)

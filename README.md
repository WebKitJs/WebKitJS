WebKitJs
========

An object oriented JavaScript framework that uses jQuery for DOM abstraction and Closure Compiler 
for code minification. Components and widgets are created using HTML templates 
(using jQuery, HTML, CSS)

Coding conventions	- OOP, MVC, Observer Pattern, JS PseudoClassical inheritance


Dependencies
------------
- jQuery - for dom abstraction and fx
- Plovr - for run time and distribution builds
- Closure Compiler - used for code checking and minification (included by Plovr)
- Google Closure - required use is goog.provide, goog.require (included by Plovr)

Skills dependencies
-------------------
- OOP, MVC, Observer Pattern
- jQuery for widget development
- General understanding of DOM and JS frameworks
- General understanding of typing
- Understanding of Google Closure Compiler

Minification
------------
Closure Compiler - ADVANCED mode, which enables dependency tree exclusion of unused classes 
and methods as well as variable- and function name minification.


Pros
----
- Enforces strong documentation
- Proven scalability
- Highly effective minification

Cons
----
Some learning curve
